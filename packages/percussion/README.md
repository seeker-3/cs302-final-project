## Description

The percussion module is a drum machine with some cool features on top. Drums can be added and removed, beats can be added and removed, you can select where you want an instrument to play, and drum patterns can be shifted, all of the normal drum machine things, but it has some unique features as well. The user can record a series of taps, claps, or snaps and the drum machine will fit that pattern to a perfectly timed drum machine where it can be played using a variety of instrument sounds. You can also load multiple recordings to layer them over each other and it will fit them together to play in perfect tempo. All generated drum patterns can be edited and moved just like any other drum pattern.
