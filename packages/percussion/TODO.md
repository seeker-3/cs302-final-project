# Percussion TODOS

1. make number of beats work with html number input. Should be able to set number of beats to a specific number. Number of beats should also be independent of whether or not there is a drum array.
2. have it so the synth type of a drum array change be changed after creation e.g. from kick to snare.
3. Having saving the percussion to a WAV not affect the playing audio.
4. Be able to adjust the tempo of the drum. The tempo seems to randomly change if you generate a drum array from a file.
