## Description

The merge module takes two audio files and overlaps them with one another (using the [Crunker](https://github.com/jackedgson/crunker) package)

The merge module produces a wav file whose contents include the overlapped audios of two separate audio files.
e.g. AudioFile1.wav + AudioFile2.wav = MergedAudioFile.wav.
